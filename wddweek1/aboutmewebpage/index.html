    <p>I am a CS Major considering switching to more of a CIT degree. I love swimming, playing Pickleball, and reading some good old Brandon Sanderson. Currently not married but always looking for the right girl!</p>
    <p>While I know computer science is a field that is currently exploding, and sometimes that means later it will be a dead field, I also know that everyone is coming to rely more and more on computers. They are something I love to work with and I am confident that the things I am doing will still be relevant when I am trying to stay employed.</p>
    <p>I testify that the Book of Mormon is truly the word of God. It contains the answers to lifeâ€™s most compelling questions. Its truths have the power to inspire, comfort, restore, strengthen, console, and cheer our souls. It is my hope that each of us will see this book, today and always, as it really is: more precious than all the riches in the world. -Russell M. Nelson</p>
