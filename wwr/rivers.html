                    <p class="about_paragraph">Nestled deep in the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return winds the Salmon
                        river. The Salmon was given the nickname long ago as the River of No Return by people living
                        near it because of the number of folks that came to visit and fell so in love with the rugged
                        beauty of the river that they never left.</p>
                    <p class="about_paragraph">Herds of elk and deer graze on the hillsides around the river and bear
                        and bighorn sheep are also commonly sighted. The river corridor is also lined with awe inspiring
                        ponderosa pine which tower over the sandy beaches in the campsites and provide shelter from sun
                        or rain when needed.</p>
                    <p class="about_paragraph">Let's not forget the rapids! They range from class I-IV. The Salmon is
                        one of the longest undammed rivers in the United States. As a free flowing river the water is
                        higher, faster, and colder in the early summer and lower, slower, and warmer in the late summer.
                        There are good rapids all summer...but families with children who like to swim tend to
                        appreciate the late summer's slower, warmer water more.</p>

                    <p class="about_paragraph">Grand Canyon river rafting combines world-class whitewater with
                        breathtaking scenery to make one truly unforgettable river experience. The canyon is filled not
                        only with exhilarating whitewater rapids, but with side canyons and ancient indian ruins
                        accessible only by river.</p>
                    <p class="about_paragraph">CLASS I - X: The Grand Canyon uses a unique river rating scale. The
                        rapids in the Canyon are technically rated I - X ( 1 - 10) to accommodate such a wide variety of
                        rapids and river variances. However, most people are familiar with the regular I - V river
                        rating scale, so we often refer to both.</p>

                    <p class="about_paragraph">Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the most desolate
                        land anywhere, the Green river flows towards the mighty Colorado river and the sea. High grey
                        stone cliffs, beautiful desert scenery, and great rapids have made this run famous. This 84-mile
                        trip runs from from Sand Wash to Swaseys Rapid (just outside Green River Utah) and boasts
                        outstanding scenery, interesting geologic formations, evidence of prehistoric and historic human
                        activity, and great whitewater opportunities.</p>
                    <p class="about_paragraph">
                        Desolation is rated a Class II/III and is usually done in 6 days.

                        Desolation Canyon has been recognized as a National Landmark. This designation is based on the
