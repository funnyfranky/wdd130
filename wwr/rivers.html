                    <h3>Main Fork of the Salmon River - Idaho</h3>
                    <p class="flex_section">Nestled deep in the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return winds the Salmon
                        river. The Salmon was given the nickname long ago as the River of No Return by the people living
                        near it because of the number of folks that came to visit and fell so in love with the rugged
                        beauty of the river that they never left.
                    </p>
                    <p class="flex_section">
                        Herds of elk and deer graze on the hillsides around the river and bear and bighorn sheep are
                        also commonly sighted. The river corridor is also lined with awe inspiring ponderosa pine which
                        tower over the sandy beaches in the campsites and provide shelter from sun or rain when needed.
                    </p>
                    <p class="flex_section">
                        Let's not forget the rapids! They range from class I-IV. The Salmon is one of the longest
                        undammed rivers in the United States. As a free flowing river the water is higher, faster, and
                        colder in the early summer and lower, slower, and warmer in the late summer. There are good
                        rapids all summer...but families with children who like to swim tend to appreciate the late
                        summer's slower, warmer water more.</p>
